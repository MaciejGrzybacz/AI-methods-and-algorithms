Dear Student,

I'm happy to announce that you've managed to get **16** out of 16 points for this assignment.
You have fulfilled the Bobot's wish and earned all the scores. Should you be proud of yourself? Sure, you should, but be humble: If such a thing has happened once, it must surely have happened many times in this galaxy of a hundred billion suns.
